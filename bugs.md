# Cascade

  - raw functions that are added as outflows of (deep) multiple cascades are invoked multiple times

    fixing would require changing the implementation to store pending states in a closure, rather than on the objects themselves

    the same could be done with inflows and outflows so the function wouldn't have properties added to it
